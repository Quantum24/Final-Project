<div class="about-content"> I love dogs, and I'd love to watch YOUR dog! Your dog needs love and care, and I strive to provide that. We have a large, fenced in yard, along with an acre of private land to play and run around in.
    My family all loves dogs too, so your dog will always have someone looking after them and get plenty of attention. If you're in the Washington area and have a dog you need watched, give me a text or call at 999-999-9999</div>
